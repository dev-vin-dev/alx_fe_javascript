# alx_fe_javascript

Objective
The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate advanced DOM manipulation techniques using pure JavaScript. It emphasizes generating, modifying, and interacting with dynamic content directly through JavaScript—without relying on frameworks or libraries like React, Vue, or jQuery.

By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to:
Create dynamic HTML elements using JavaScript
Attach event listeners to those elements
Modify styles and structure in real-time
Build fully interactive components using DOM APIs

🚀 Features
Dynamic element creation (createElement, appendChild, etc.)
Real-time user interaction (e.g., buttons, forms, event handlers)
Custom component building (tabs, modals, interactive lists, etc.)
Responsive updates to the DOM without page reloads

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
No frameworks or third-party libraries are used. This is a fully vanilla JavaScript implementation.
